# CCS3153 NLP Assignment: Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview
*   **Course:** CCS3153 Natural Language Processing (Semester 1 2024/2025)
*   **Type:** Group Assignment (Max 3 students)
*   **Goal:** Develop a Python-based program to perform sentiment analysis.
*   **Deadlines:**
    *   **Report Submission:** 11 January 2026 (11:59 PM)
    *   **Demonstration:** Week 11 (Face-to-face in lab sessions)

## Project Requirements

### 1. Data Collection (CLO2)
*   **Source:** Publicly available corpus (plain text).
*   **Constraint:** Must be from the recent 5 years. No copyright issues.
*   **Task:** Select ONE of the following:
    1.  **Polarity:** Positive, Negative, Neutral.
    2.  **Ranking:** Very Good, Good, Average, Bad, Very Bad.
    3.  **Fine-grained:** Scale of 1 to 5 (Very Negative to Very Positive).
    4.  **Emotional States:** Joy, Anger, Sadness, etc.
    5.  **Comparison:** Comparing entities/brands.
    6.  **Other:** Any relevant sentiment analysis task.

### 2. Framework Design (CLO2)
*   **Models:** Implement at least **TWO (2) machine learning techniques**.
*   **Pipeline:**
    *   Pre-processing
    *   Feature Engineering
    *   Classification Algorithm
    *   Optimization/Hyperparameter tuning
    *   Evaluation method
*   **Requirement:** Description must be clear (use flowcharts/diagrams).

### 3. Implementation (CLO3)
*   **Language:** Python.
*   **Visualization:** Code must produce graphical representations of evaluation results.
*   **Optional:** Deployment/Interface development.

### 4. Evaluation & Analysis (CLO2)
*   **Visualizations Required:**
    *   At least **1** for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
    *   At least **2** for result evaluation (Graphs, Scatterplots, Boxplots, etc.).
*   **Analysis:**
    *   Compare and interpret results of both ML methods.
    *   Investigate anomalies.
    *   Provide a conclusion.

## Deliverables
